# Kaholas

A small working prototype:
1) Which shows a*b ( reads text to speech)  where a and b are random integers from 1 to 9.
2) These random integers gets refreshed after refreshing.
3) And after it reads it waits for user input -> 
4) if user says the correct answer -> it says correct.
5) If users says something else -> it says incorrect.
